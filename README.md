RAG'ed Mankuthimmana Kagga GPT ðŸ“œ
------------------------

Your Personal Philosopher: This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide philosophical insights from Mankuthimmana Kagga. It leverages a curated knowledge base to ground the LLM's responses, making them contextually accurate and relevant.

--------------------
**Tech Stack for My Experiments with LLM augmentation using RAG, Vector embedding's, Vector DB store, involves:**

- Agent Framework: **LangChain** for orchestrating the RAG workflow.
- Vector Embeddings: A **Google embedding model** to convert text into vector representations.
- Vector Database: **Pinecone** for high-performance storage and retrieval of embeddings.
- Generative Model: **Gemini on LangChain** for generating coherent responses.
- Language: **TypeScript** for a robust and type-safe application.
-----------------------
**How It Works: The system follows a standard RAG pipeline:**

- Unstructured data sorce from pdf, docs etc. is loaded, chunked, and embedded using Lanchain tool and Google embedding model.
- These embeddings are stored in a Pinecone vector database and indexed.
- When a user query is received, the system retrieves the most relevant text chunks from the database.
- The retrieved context is then provided to the Gemini LLM, which uses this information to generate a grounded and insightful response, _ergo ur Philosopher_. 
------------------
**Getting Started**
Prerequisites: 
- Pinecone and Google API keys.
- Installation:
```
git clone <repository-url>
npm install
```
- Configuration: Create a .env file and add your keys:
```
PINECONE_API_KEY=YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY
GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY
```
- Running:
```
npm run ingest to populate the database.

npm start to run the application.
```
